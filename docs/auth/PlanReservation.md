## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**next_plan_id** | **str** |  | [optional] 
**using_next_plan_from** | **int** | This parameter is set when reserving a pricing plan change for a future date and time. It is not required for immediate application. When specifying the next pricing plan start date and time, please specify a date and time at least 5 minutes after the current time. Note for Stripe integration: By specifying the beginning of the current month (00:00 UTC) as the start date and time, you can create a subscription that starts from the first day of that month. (Example: To specify January 1, 2023 00:00 UTC â†’ 1672531200)  | [optional] 
**next_plan_tax_rate_id** | **str** |  | [optional] 
**proration_behavior** | [**ProrationBehavior**](ProrationBehavior.md) |  | [optional] 
**delete_usage** | **bool** | If you have a stripe linkage,  you can set whether to delete pay-as-you-go items when changing plans. When you change plan, you can remove all pay-as-you-go items included in your current subscription to stop being billed based on pay-as-you-go items. The recorded usage is cleared immediately. Since it cannot be restored, please note that plan change reservations with delete_usage set to true cannot be canceled.  | [optional]
